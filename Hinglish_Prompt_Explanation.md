To generate natural Hinglish radio conversation, the prompt strictly enforced an informal FM radio tone. It required alternating speakers, casual fillers such as “ha yaar”, “achha”, laughter, and short interruptions. The prompt also restricted output to dialogue-only format, avoiding narration. Wikipedia content was used as factual grounding while allowing conversational paraphrasing. Line-count constraints ensured balanced participation between both hosts. These combined constraints helped the language model produce human-like, conversational Hinglish suitable for radio rather than robotic speech.
